    "\n",
    "#What to do:\n",
    "#Create a function called greet_person that takes two parameters:\n",
    "#name (a string): The person's name\n",
    "#language (a string, optional): Their favorite programming language (default to \"Python\" if not provided)\n",
    "#Inside the function, create a greeting message that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "#\"Hello, [name]! Welcome to Python programming!\"\n",
    "#If a language is provided (and it's not \"Python\"), also add: \"I see you're interested in [language] too!\"\n",
    "#Return the greeting message as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "#Test your function with:\n",
    "\n",
    "#greet_person(\"Alice\") (should use default language)\n",
    "#greet_person(\"Bob\", \"JavaScript\") (should mention JavaScript)\n",

    "#Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Use def to define your function\n",

    "#Use conditional statements (if) to check if the language is provided and different from \"Python\"\n",

    "#What is the main advantage of using functions instead of writing the same code multiple times?\n",
    "# Once you define a new function, you can run it multiple times without needing to write all the code again. Plus it allows to check errors in one place\n",
    "#instead of multiple places if you keep writing new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In Exercise 1, why did we use a default parameter value for language?\n",
    "# We used a default parameter for language as the course was called Python - so assumes one has interest in learning Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In Exercise 2, why is it important to check the conditions in order from highest to lowest (90, then 80, then 70, etc.)?\n",
    "# Because Python would stop checking once the conditions are met, so the higher numbers would get an incorrect grade. So it needs to check from highest\n",
    "# to lowest otherwise it would stop.\n",
    "#How did the pseudocode help you in Exercise 2? What would have been different if you had to write it from scratch?\n",
